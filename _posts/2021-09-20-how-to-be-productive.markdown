This is the list of things that I find important for my productivity.

__Work on the right things__

Identify the important things early and frequent and spend a lot of time working on them.  Many people like to pretend to be busy, but most of the time they end up not working on the right things.  

__Get enough sleep__

Sleep, in my opinion, is the cheapest and easiest way to improve your happiness and overall productivity is by getting enough rest daily.  If you don't do anything else, do this.

__Exercise, and do it early in the morning__

When I was working on my startup, there were bad days that I feel miserable, and the only thing that really helped is exercise and exercising early in the morning.  Even if you hate exercising, just a 15 minutes run will be make a huge difference to your day.  

__Don't waste time on things that don't matter__  

If you look at your daily todo list, you'll find that you care about, or spend time on, do not matter.

__The 10-10-10 rule__

When facing a question of whether something is important enough for me to spend my time working on, I use this 10-10-10 rule.  The rule is by asking yourself whether the thing you care about right now will mean anything in 10 days, in 10 months, and in 10 years.  Most of the things don't matter after 10 months, and definitely not a lot of things matter after 10 years.  But when you find them, spend a lot of time working on them.

__Decide and decide quickly__

In the past, I usually find myself taking a lot of time deciding on which options to take.  Later, I realize that

__Stay focus__

There are a ton of self-help books that try to tell you to stay focus  Do not multitask, you'll get nothing done.

__Do a little everyday__
