I've spent a lot of time reading books on how to improve productivity.  The general advice from these self-help books has always been
- Wake up at 5 am
- Say no more often
- Have a clear goal and a todo list
- Work on the most important thing first thing in the morning 
- Do one thing at a time.
- Build a good habit
- Finish what you start
- Use either a time blocking or the Pomodoro technique to get work done.

Most of these self-help books could be summarized into a single page, but authors need to make a living, so they all write 300+ pages books trying to sell you the same message.  The other thing you will notice is that some advice don't work for you.  For example, even though I am an early riser - I don't believe in the wake-up at 5 am advice.  Waking up at 5 am might help you become more discipline, but lacking sleep will ruin your productivity faster than anything else. 

I don't regret reading these self-help books, even though I could use the time for something more productive and important. 

After reading enough of these productivity books, here are things that improve my productivity.

# The productivity formula

This is what works for me.

### *Productivity = energy x focus x time* 

For you to max out your productivity, you have to keep your energy level up.  Working on complex things is hard when your energy level is low.  The next important thing in this formula is your ability to focus.  It's hard to get anything done if you cannot stay focused.  And then there's time.  To get something done, you must spend time on it.  

Based on this formula, if your energy level, focus, or time falls is less than 1, your productivity will always suffer no matter how hard you try. 

If you can figure out a way to 10x one of these elements (energy, focus, or time) and keep the other elements above 1, you will get many things done. 

So if *Productivity = energy x focus x time* is the formula to get things done, what could you do to improve the variables to maximize the Productivity outcome?

### Energy

__Get enough sleep__

A good night's sleep is the easiest way to improve your happiness and overall productivity.  If you don't do anything else, do this.

It's the easiest way to improve both your energy level and the ability to focus and improve the outcome of your productivity formula. 

__Exercise, and do it early in the morning__

The other trick to maximize your energy level is exercising. 

When I was working on my startup, there were days that I felt miserable. The only thing that helped was exercising, especially early in the morning.  Even if you hate exercising or cannot find the time, a 15 minutes walk/run will make a difference to your day.  

### Focus

__Work on the right things__

Identify essential things early and frequently and spend time working on them.  Many seem busy, but most spend time on the wrong things.  You won't get much done if you work on the wrong things.  This is the most important secret about productivity that people don't tell you.  

Why? Because identifying the right things to work on is hard, and it is different from person to person, so most people avoid giving you this advice.  Every piece of advice wants you to put in the time and focus on getting things done, but they need to tell you that you have to work on the right things. 

The question is, how can you identify the right things to work on?  Look deeper into each project you want to get done, the items you want to spend time on, and the things you must do.  One of my filter criteria has been running a cost-benefit analysis on things I want to get done.  And for me, I always pick the things I am passionate about and the things I don't regret later when I look back.  The other criteria that work well for me are to pick projects and things to learn that result in the snowballing effect -- the things that the more you know about them and the more you spend time working on will make you become more valuable and make it hard for someone to catch up to. 

Jeff Bezos of Amazon uses A regret minimization framework to evaluate things.

>> "I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have,'" explains Bezos. "I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret was not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so when I thought about it that way, it was an incredibly easy decision."

__The 10-10-10 rule__

When facing whether something is essential to work on, use the 10-10-10 rule by asking yourself whether the thing you care about right now will mean anything in 10 days, 10 months, and 10 years.  Most items don't matter after ten months, and many things do not matter after ten years.  But when you apply this 10-10-10 rule and find something that matter, spend time working on them.

### Time 

__Say no__

This is an instant productivity boost.  Warren Buffet once said, "The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."

I don't expect this to be easy, but with practice, you'll be able to get more time back for yourself to spend on things that are important to you. 

__Make decisions quickly__

When you have to decide, do it quickly.  You’ll make mistakes, and you have to adjust your success framework to endure failure, but making a decision is always better than no decision.  Being decisive and making decisions quickly will get you to uncover the unknowns faster and, in turn, get you to your goals sooner. 

__Do a little every day__.

Last, create a habit of working on things every day.  Being disciplined and putting in the time to work on things that matter will make you successful.  As the saying goes, bird by bird.   

“Excellence is doing ordinary things extraordinarily well.”
