I've spent a lot of time reading books on how to improve productivity.  The general advice from these self-help books has always been
- Wake up at 5 am
- Say no more often
- Have a clear goal and a todo list
- Work on the most important thing first thing in the morning 
- Do one thing at a time.
- Build a good habit
- Finish them
- Use either a time blocking or the Pomodoro technique to get work done

Most of these self-help books could be summarized into a single page, but authors need to make a living, so they all write 300 pages books trying to sell you the same message. 

I don't regret reading many of them, even though I could use the time for something more productive. 

After reading enough of these productivity books, here are things that improve my productivity.

**The productivity formula**

For me, the productivity formula is 

*Productivity = your energy level x focus x time* 

For you to max out your productivity, you have to keep your energy level up.  Working on complex things is hard when your energy level is low.  The next important thing in this formula is your ability to focus.  It's hard to get anything done if you cannot stay focused.  And then there's time.  To get something done, you must spend time on it.  

Based on this formula, if your energy level, focus, or time falls is less than 1, then no matter how hard you try, your productivity will always suffer. 

If you can figure out a way to 10x one of these elements (energy, focus, or time) and keep the other elements above 1, you will get many things done. 

__Work on the right things__

Identify essential things early and frequently and spend time working on them.  Many seem busy, but most spend time on the wrong things.  You won't get much done if you work on the wrong things.  This is probably the most important secret about productivity that people don't tell you.  

Why? Because identifying the right things to work on is hard, and it is different from person to person, so most people avoid giving you this advice.  Every piece of advice wants you to put in the time and focus on getting things done, but they don't tell you that you have to work on the right things. 

The question is, how can you identify the right things to work on?  Look deeper into each of the projects that you want to get done, the things that you want to spend time on, and the things that you have to do.  One of my filter criteria has been to run a cost-benefit analysis on things that I want to get done.  And for me, I always pick the things that I am passionate about and the things that I don't regret later when I look back.  The other criteria that work well for me are to pick projects and things to learn that result in the snowballing effect -- the things that the more you know about them and the more you spend time working on will make you become more valuable, and make it hard for someone to catch up to. 

Jeff Bezos of Amazon uses A regret minimization framework to evaluate things

>> "I wanted to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Okay, now I'm looking back on my life. I want to have minimized the number of regrets I have,'" explains Bezos. "I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the Internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal. I knew that if I failed, I wouldn't regret that, but I knew the one thing I might regret is not ever having tried. I knew that that would haunt me every day, and so when I thought about it that way, it was an incredibly easy decision."


__Get enough sleep__

A good night's sleep is probably the easiest way to improve your happiness and overall productivity.  If you don't do anything else, do this.

__Exercise, and do it early in the morning__

When I was working on my startup, there were days that I felt miserable. The only thing that helped was exercising, especially early in the morning.  Even if you hate exercising or cannot find the time, a 15 minutes walk/run will make a difference to your day.  

__Don't waste time on things that don't matter__.  

If you look at your to-do, you'll find that many things are unnecessary, and you shouldn’t waste time working on them.  Please get rid of them, and focus on the things that matter. 

__The 10-10-10 rule__

When facing whether something is essential to work on, use the 10-10-10 rule by asking yourself whether the thing you care about right now will mean anything in 10 days, ten months, and ten years.  Most items don't matter after ten months, and many things do not matter after ten years.  But when you find something that matter, spend time working on them.

__Make decisions quickly__

When you have to decide, do it quickly.  You’ll make mistakes but making a decision soon is always better than no decision. 

__Stay focus__

There are a ton of self-help books that try to tell you to stay focused. Do not multitask; you'll get nothing done. 

__Do a little every day__.

Last, create a habit of working on things every day.  When you have an extensive todo list and feel overwhelmed
