Recently someone created an (app)[https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-time/page/0/0] to aggregate books recommended by Hacker News.

I thought this project is very neat because it used NLP models to look at hacker news comments and figure out how books are mentioned.



Here's a list of top books from this page:

- Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
- The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas
- Dune by Frank Herbert
- Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson
- The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins
- Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker
- The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
- Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
- Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

If you are an avid readers, you've heard about most of  top 100 books on this list.  However, it's still very neat to have this list around.   The other thing worths mentioning is some of the book from this page

I ended up getting 7 new books after visiting this cool project

- Brave New World
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
- Cryptonomicon
- The Selfish Gene
- Economics in One Lesson
- Never Split the Difference
- The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.
