Recently someone created an [app][1] to aggregate books recommended by Hacker News.

Here's the [hacker news post][2].

This project uses NLP models to look at hacker news comments and recommends books from the aggregated words.

Here’s a list of top books from this page:

- Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman
- The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas
- Dune by Frank Herbert
- Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson
- The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins
- Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker
- The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman
- Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
- Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

If you are an avid reader, you’ve heard about most of the top 100 books on this list. Still, it’s a neat list of good books to keep around, especially books that the hacker news community mentioned in the last six months.  Here is NLP plus the wisdom of the crowd.

One thing worth mentioning is that books recommended here are geared towards the tech and hacker news community - a community of hackers, entrepreneurs, and founders in the tech community.

I end up getting seven new books after visiting this project:
- Brave New World
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
- Cryptonomicon
- The Selfish Gene
- Economics in One Lesson
- Never Split the Difference
- The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right.
